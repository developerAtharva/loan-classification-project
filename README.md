# 🚀 Loan Classification Project 🚀

### 🔍 **Overview**

Welcome to the **Loan Classification Project**! This project dives into the world of data science and machine learning to predict whether a loan application will be **approved (1)** or **rejected (0)**. By analyzing various factors like income, age, credit score, and employment history, we train a machine learning model to make accurate loan predictions. After experimenting with multiple models, **Decision Trees** took the crown as the top performer. 🏆

### 🎯 **Project Objective**

The aim is to predict loan approval based on applicants' personal and financial details. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model identifies patterns in the data that dictate whether a loan will be approved. The features range from **age**, **income**, and **education level** to more specific ones like **loan interest rate** and **credit score**.

### 📊 **Dataset Overview**

The dataset is rich with features representing an applicant’s financial and personal background. Here’s a peek at the key data points:

- **person_age**: Applicant's age (float) 📅
- **person_gender**: Gender of the applicant (string) ⚧
- **person_education**: Highest level of education (string) 🎓
- **person_income**: Annual income in USD (float) 💵
- **person_emp_exp**: Years of employment experience (int) 💼
- **person_home_ownership**: Type of home ownership (string) 🏡
- **loan_amnt**: Requested loan amount (float) 💰
- **loan_int_rate**: Loan interest rate (float) 📈
- **loan_percent_income**: Loan amount as a percentage of income (float) 💡
- **credit_score**: Credit score of the applicant (int) 🏦
- **previous_loan_defaults_on_file**: History of loan defaults (string) ⚠️
- **loan_status**: Target variable (1 = approved, 0 = rejected) ✅❌

### ⚡ **Steps Taken**

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensured no missing values or irrelevant data points.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovered interesting insights (e.g., income vs loan approval trends).
3. **Model Building**: Experimented with multiple algorithms:
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - **Decision Tree** (Best Model 🌟)
   - Random Forest
   - AdaBoost
   - Gradient Boosting
   - XGBoost
4. **Model Evaluation**: Compared models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Best Model**: **Decision Tree** emerged as the leader, providing the most reliable results.

### 🏆 **The Winning Model: Decision Tree**

After testing multiple algorithms, **Decision Tree** was the winner! 🎉 This model achieved the best classification accuracy by identifying clear decision points in the data, such as:
- **Credit Score**: Higher credit scores = higher approval rates.
- **Income**: Applicants with higher income have a better chance of approval.
- **Credit History Length**: Longer credit histories lead to higher approval chances.
- **Loan Amount**: Larger loan amounts might reduce the chances of approval.
